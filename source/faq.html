Furthermore, homes listed can be on the market for 6+ months and sometimes, waiting that long to liquidate your cash can be troublesome when you have bills to pay. At Expand Estates, we are home buyers that can pay all cash. We can close within a week and you will see all the cash in your bank account immediatlely after that. We buy the homes an any condition and we can negotiate to come up with a fair price",

Within 24 hours, we will reach out to you to introduce ourselves and potentially ask for additional information regarding the property. Soon after, we will provide a simple offer letter and we can discuss the contents and the process on call.

                    "When will I recieve the money after my house is sold?",

                    "Just like any other home selling process, we reach out to a verified thrid party Real Estate Attorney and Title Company and we will put the money in escrow. Once everything is finalized, they will either issue a check or a wire transfer depending on what you decide.",
